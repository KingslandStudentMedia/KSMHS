    <p style="font-family: times new roman">Ryan is a native Houstonian. Around age 8 he asked Jesus to come into his life and save him from the consequences of his sins. By the time he graduated from Jersey Village High School in 1997 he had been through many ups and downs in his journey with Jesus, but the Lord was faithful and merciful and set his life on a path that has been nothing short of amazing. He attended the University of Tulsa to play football and get his education. There he met the most beautiful girl on campus - his future wife, Ashlie. After graduating and spending 2 years in Colorado the Lord opened a door for them to move back to Houston and begin serving at a great church in Sugar Land. They moved there in June of 2004 to serve at Sugar Creek Baptist in the student ministry. He was able to pursue his education and received his Masters from Southwestern Seminary in May of 2009. Then in 2010 they were blessed by the birth of their first son, Peyton. In March of 2012 God opened another door for the Cook's to come serve at Kingsland Baptist. In May 2013 they were blessed with their second son, Gracen. Finally in April of 2016 God gave them a beautiful daughter, Adeline. In what free time he has, Ryan likes to work out and try to play golf – the key word being "try."</p>
